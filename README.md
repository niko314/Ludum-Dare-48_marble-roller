#Ludum-Dare-48_marble-roller

This game was created completely from the beginning in 48 hours for the 48 Ludum Dare.
Theme: deeper and deeper

You can find the installer for mac and windows above. To install the game you have to click on the installer you need(mac/windows) and then click download in the top right corner. Then proceed like with any other you have installed so far (the system may warn you that the software isn't from a certified developer).

How to play:
You are controlling a marble ball that rolls down. You can slow it down with s and jump with w.
For some jumps you will need a lot of speed and for some you need to slow the marble down.
There are also checkpoints. Have fun.
