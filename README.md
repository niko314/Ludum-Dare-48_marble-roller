#Ludum-Dare-48_marble-roller

This game was created completely from beginning in 48 hours for the 48 Ludum Dare.
Theme: deeper and deeper

You can find the installer for mac above.

How to play:
You are controlling a marble ball that rolls down. You can slow it down with s and jump with w.
For some jumps you will need a lot of speed and for some you need to slow the marble down.
There are also checkpoints. Have fun.
